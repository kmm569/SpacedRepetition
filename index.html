        <p>&quot;Spaced repetition is a powerful technique that will help you memorize information in much less time than it would take otherwise. The idea of spaced repetition is to space out your repetitions – or review sessions – so that you are not trying
            to cram all the knowledge into your brain at once.&quot;<sup><a href="https://e-student.org/spaced-repetition/">1</a></sup> </p>

        <ul>
            <li>It continually re-exposes you to information.</li>
            <li>It helps strengthen your memory.</li>
            <li>It helps to increase active study time and learning, rather than just passively taking in information that may or may not be remembered.</li>
            <li>It helps you to relate new material with previously stored material, and make connections.</li>
